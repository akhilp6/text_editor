The major part(more than 90%) is implemented in a pair-programming fashion, with each backing other.

1. Creation of data nodes (get_node)
2. Identifying length (length_text)
3. Setting height at all nodes while backtracking (setHeight)
4. Rotations - left and right(left_rotation(), right_rotation())
5. Inserting new line at specified index and renumbering(insert_line())

1. Creation of tree(with create_text)
2. Obtaining line, when line number is given(get_line)
3. Appending new line at end (append_line())
4. Deleting line at specified index and renumbering(delete_line())
5. Replacing a line at given index(set_line())

Note: We took help from class notes of Dr. Kemafor for some of the tree operations.
